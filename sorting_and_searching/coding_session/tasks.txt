1. Write a function that takes in an array of distinct integers as well as an integer k and that returns the kth smallest integer in that array.
The function should do this in linear time, on average.

Sample:
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 7, 6, 3]
k = 3
Output: 5


2.
Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target
integer. The function should use a variation of the Binary Search algorithm to
find a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the
array and should return this range in the form of an array.

Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target
integer. The function should find a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the
array and should return this range in the form of an array.

The first number in the output array should represent the first index at which
the target number is located, while the second number should represent the
last index at which the target number is located. The function should return
[-1, -1] if the integer isn't contained in the array.

Sample:
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73]
target = 45
output: [4, 9]
