// Given weighted graph (all weights are non-negative), find shortest path between two verticies s and t.
// Besides, there is some physical limitation for every vertex: v d[v -> t] >= f[v]. Example: cities in physical world
// Main idea - optimize Dikstra in such a way that it doesn't visit far verticies
