## Approach: Constant Space Smoothened Image

### Intuition

If we modify `img[i][j]` in place, we can't use the original value in subsequent calculations. The idea is to store both pre-modified and post-modified values in the same cell by encoding them into a single number.

Assume two independent numbers, `p` and `r`. Define another number `Y` as `Y = p * X + r`, where `X` is a constant. To extract `p` and `r`, use `Y / X` and `Y % X`, respectively.

### Choosing `X`

- `r` (remainder) ranges from 0 to X-1.
- Constraints: 0 <= img[i][j] <= 255.
- To limit `r` to 255, choose `X` as 256.

### Algorithm

1. Save image dimensions (`m` rows, `n` columns).
2. Iterate over cells of the image.
    - Initialize `sum` and `count` to 0.
    - Iterate over plausible nine indices (neighbors).
    - Extract the original value of `img[x][y]` using `img[x][y] % 256`, add it to `sum`, and increment `count`.
    - Encode the smoothed value in `img[i][j]` as `img[i][j] += (sum / count) * 256`.
3. Traverse the image again, extract the smoothed value from `img[i][j]`, and update the cell.
4. Return the modified image.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(m * n).
- Space complexity: O(1).

Note: The constant X (256) allows for efficient operations. The number 256 being a power of two offers potential optimizations for modulo, multiplication, and division operations, providing a faster approach.
