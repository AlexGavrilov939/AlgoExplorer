## Approach: DP

### Algorithm

1. Establish a dynamic programming approach to identify arithmetic subsequences.
2. Define the state representation as f[i][d], denoting weak arithmetic subsequences with a common difference that conclude at nums[i].
3. Iterate over previous elements (j < i) and compute the difference (nums[i] - nums[j]), updating the count.
4. Incorporate weak arithmetic subsequences by incrementing the count by 1 for pairs (i, j).
5. Directly tally pure weak arithmetic subsequences as pairs (i, j) considering nums[i] and nums[j].
6. Adjust the answer by accounting for the number of newly formed arithmetic subsequences during element appending.
7. Illustrate the process using an example sequence, discerning weak and arithmetic subsequences using nums.
8. The final result represents the total count of arithmetic subsequences in nums.

### Complexity Analysis

Certainly:

**Time Complexity (TC):**
- `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops iterating over each element in `nums`.

**Space Complexity (SC):**
- `O(n^2`) in the worst case, primarily due to the storage of differences and counts in `differenceCountMap`.
The constant space variables have negligible impact.
